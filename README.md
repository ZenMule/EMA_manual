# EMA_manual
 
 This is a manual of doing experiments using Electromagnetic Articulography (EMA).

 The manual consists of two parts: the procedure of the experiment and the post-processing of the data.

 This approach requires using AG501 to collect data, and MATLAB to post-process the raw data. It specifically utilizes a MATLAB app, MVIEW and several other scripts developed by Mark Tiede at Haskins Laboratory.
